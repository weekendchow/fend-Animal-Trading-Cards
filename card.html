			<p class="describe">The Siberian Husky is a medium size working dog breed that originated in north-eastern Siberia, Russia. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings.
         The Husky howls rather than barks. They have been described as escape artists, which can include digging under, chewing through, or even jumping over fences.
